    <h5>The Machine Learning Sensor Application </h5>
    <p>
      The Machine Learning Sensor application is a tool designed to detect DDoS attacks.
      The aim of the tool is that it can be integrated into any network infrastructure as
      long as it can be accessed by a firewall or security system. The tool was designed to
      have a simplified interface with the ability to modify its infrastructure according to the user's needs.
      The initial project was designed to be used on an SDN (Software Defined Networks) model, which was
      demonstrated in the "Demonstration" Section. However, the project is easily adaptable to other models,
      allowing it to be integrated with other firewalls, IDS security systems, or even local firewalls that have input
      and output interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>The functionality of the application is represented by the image below.
      The diagram demonstrates the flow of the application from its initialization (Init Process and Select model),
      the permission request to the security server (Request Server Permission), loading the pre-trained models and
      entering the test flow cycle.
      When an attack is detected, the security server is notified.</p>

      <h2>About Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
      <p>In this project, five Machine Learning algorithms are used with relevance in probabilistic, linear, 
        tree and artificial neural network models. Below is a brief description of these [Occhipinti et al. 2022, Ganaie et al. 2022].</p>
      
      <Ul>
        <li><b>Gaussian Naive Bayes:</b> based on Bayes' theorem, this algorithm belongs to the probabilistic family of classifiers. 
        Using the prior probability according to the class samples provided,
         when a new sample is inserted, the algorithm calculates the probability of this sample belonging to one of the previously trained classes.
        </li>
        <li><b>Support Vector Machine:</b> is a linear classifier based on finding the hyperplane, which provides the maximum 
        separation distance between classes and allows the classification of data point
        </li>
        <li><b>Random Forest:</b> the classifier combines multiple decision trees in which each classifier is built from given data and the results are combined to make predictions. 
          The model is contained in classifiers that use graph techniques commonly called trees. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Multilayer Perceptron:</b>  is a model of Artificial Neural Networks. MLP consists of several layers connected by neurons and each layer is connected to the next,
           mapping an input set to an output set. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Stacking Classifier:</b> allows you to group several classifiers that are used as a basis for training the model. The model uses a meta-learning algorithm to 
          learn the best combinations of predictions across multiple algorithms [Ganaie et al. 2022]. For the model proposed for this study, the algorithms used in the stacking technique were: 
          Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron. </li>
      </Ul>

    <p>The models have different characteristics depending on the metrics they have.
      The system administrator has the possibility to choose which algorithm meets his needs. For example, if it needs
      fast algorithms, it does not depend on false positives. The Stacking Classifier ensemble algorithm showed higher
      detection speed than the Randon Forest algorithm according to the Response Time Machine Learning Algorithms chart.
      However, in the metrics presented in the Machine Learning Metrics chart, the Random Forest models have greater
      precision (Precision metric). Another example, the Randon Forest model obtained the best results in the Precision
      metric, but the Gaussian Naive Bayes model obtained the best result in the Recall metric.
      In this example, the model has the characteristic of reducing false negatives.</p>
